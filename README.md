The first analysis shows the number of rides over a one year period. Rides decline in winter months. An additional analysis of the types of riders shows that casual riders 
bike less in winter than riders in a team.

The second looks at the overall rides by destination for the full population in a map. It then breaks out destination for casual versus team riders. There is a definite 
difference in one are of the map. It could be there are more homes then real "destonations" in the group where there are more casual rides than team rides.

The third analysis looks at teh top ten destination and start points. The data points to the fact that the majority of rides are "round trips".
